You have an a small planet and you need to keep your people alive
As time goes on you get more people and your planet can only hold so many people
So you need a way to get rid of them or move to a larger planet (Takes a lot of resources && is kind of unobtainable)

When you send a small number of people off your planet to another planet, really we're just adding them to someone else's game making their lives a bit more
chaotic.


You get a small bonus for accepting some new people but also a few penalties (illness)
